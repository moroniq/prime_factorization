\# Prime Factorization ðŸ”¢



This simple Python script takes a number from the user and returns its prime factors.



\## ðŸ“Œ Project Description



The goal of this project is to take a single integer input and break it down into its prime components â€” if any.  

For example, `60` becomes `\[2, 2, 3, 5]`.



The script uses a basic loop and modulo division to determine whether a number is divisible by an incrementing divisor, starting from 2. Every time it finds a divisor, it divides the original number by it and stores it in a list.



\## ðŸ’¡ What You'll Learn



\- Basic number theory (prime factorization)

\- Using `while` loops and conditionals

\- The `try`/`except`/`finally` block for input validation

\- Working with integer division (`//`) in Python

\- Building and printing a list of results



\## ðŸš€ Example



Give a number: 39999

Prime factors are: \[3, 67, 199]





\## ðŸ§  How It Works



1\. The program starts with the smallest prime (2).

2\. It checks if the number is divisible by the current divisor.

3\. If yes, it adds the divisor to a list and divides the number.

4\. If not, it moves to the next integer.

5\. The loop continues until the number is reduced to 1.
